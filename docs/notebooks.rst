Speed considertions
====================


Below there are two notebooks I used for comparing speeds of several functions that I have developed iteratively. Generally speaking, the conclusions are:

1. Pandas-based functions are quick to develop and easy to understand

2. Numpy-based functions run significantly faster than pandas-based functions

3. Numba-compiled functions run significantly faster than Numpy-based functions
